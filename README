In order to build this repository, you need to clone the following submodules
(as the current KDE git infrastructure does not support submodules)

[submodule "3rdparty/azmq"]
	path = 3rdparty/azmq
	url = https://github.com/zeromq/azmq

You can do it by executing the following from the repository root:

    mkdir 3rdparty
    git clone https://github.com/zeromq/azmq 3rdparty/azmq
