Plans for the new Lancelot:
 - Put all models into qml imports so that all Plasma
   applets can use them. Try to follow the model organization
   defined by Kickoff to be able to use some models provided by it
 - Lancelot needs to become a shell that loads QML layouts.
   This will allow easier implementation for different modes
   (like cascading popups etc.) without ruining the core code
   which was the case with L1.
 - Most of the configuration options can be removed. Instead,
   provide a few default setups as different layouts. Configuration
   might need to be per-layout, and not global.
